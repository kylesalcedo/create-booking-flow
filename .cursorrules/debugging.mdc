  When debugging a problem:
  - Ensure you have sufficient information to understand the problem deeply
  - Reflect on 5-7 different possible sources of the problem
  - Distill these down to 1-2 most likely sources
  - Implement a solution for the most likely source by either:
    - Adding more logging to validate your theory
    - Implementing the fix if extremely confident about the source
