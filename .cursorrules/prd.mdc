Project Requirements Doc:

create-booking-flow has a booking website's flow for booking a session with a clinician.
We are making batch-booker to be able to book multiple appointments at once. 
Use create-booking-flow as a reference for the workflow that is needed in order to make a more efficient "batch-booker" that can book multiple sessions with multiple clinicians at a time.

Be thorough by scanning codebase when needed and utilizing other tools. Use industry best practices to anticipate new features that may need to be added to the "Batch Booking" flow.
